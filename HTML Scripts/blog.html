        <h2>Close Reading - Overview of Data Visualisation</h2>
        <p>31/07/2023</p>
        <p>Data visualisation is a critical component in modern data science and communication is the main focus of Chapter 2 in “Embodying Data”. The reading provides a rich historical context and technical details in the exploration of the evolution of data visualisation, going from hand-drawn illustrations to sophisticated computer generated graphics to display various data. The author of the reading shows the importance of comprehensive data for effective visualisation which is a highly important concept for us to understand as a web designer.</p>

            <p>In the reading Chapter 2 of “Embodying Data” the author dives into the concept of data visualisation and tracing its roots back to the 2nd century AD where drawings and visuals were used to illustrate the world and record historical events. The author highlights the importance of data visualisation and its significant contributions to inventions and discoveries throughout human history. With the rapid growth of computer technology, it has brought about a significant shift in the data visualisation field as data analysis can be done quicker and more accurately through computer graphical data visualisation. This important evolution has made data visualisation an integral part of research in many fields.</p>

            <p>The reading also highlights the various forms and characteristics of traditional data visualisation which includes trees, scatter plots, charts, tables, diagrams etc, and the importance of understanding the meaning of the data presented in order to optimal effectiveness and efficiency. The focus of modern digital data visualisation stated by the author is the focus on communication for understanding and interpreting data rather than simply presenting data in a visually appealing way.</p>

            <p>Personally, data visualisation will be an important concept to understand and apply in my works in the future as a website developer as it is important for data to be presented on my websites to not only focus on the visual aesthetics, but also how to present data in a comprehensible way in order to have the viewer understand the data in the most clear and precise way. Websites such as “The Billion Dollar Gram” and “Top 500 Most Used Passwords visualised” both from “Information is Beautiful”, perfects shows examples of how to properly present data in data visualisation, where figures are shown through different presentations such as the The Billion Dollar 0  Gram displays the spending figures in various squares of different sizes, where the larger the spending the larger the squares as well as the numbers being displayed clearly in the top corners of the squares, correct and clear colour coding shows the different categories of spendings such as fighting, losing and giving of each countries displayed. On the other hand, Top 500 Most common passwords displays the data in an oval shape with text of different sizes visualising the most common password. Furthermore the passwords are colour coded once again to show the more in depth data of their different categories which allows for a more in depth break down to the password types thus presenting more data efficiently and effectively without adding any unnecessary visuals. These two data visualisation examples are more akin to the modern computer graphics as mentioned by the author in the reading, while a more traditional bar graph figure is also displayed for the most common passwords, however less information is present of this graph as it is only focused on the overall categories from which passwords are created from unlike the oval graph above which not only shows the data regarding the most common categories, but also specific words that are most commonly present through its use of both colour coding of categories as well as the different sized text that shows the words and how common they are in passwords.</p>

            <p>From both the reading and my own additional researches, I have come to understand the importance of data visualisation in providing not just a visually appealing way for viewers to examine data, but also the importance of the most effective way to present as much data as precisely as possible, the traditional bar graph for example does offer a visually clean presentation of data, however it lacks the more in depth data offered by the oval word chart which not only shows the information from the bar graph, but also adding the more in depth data of which words are the most common as well.</p>>

        <h2>Blog Post 3 - Close Reading - Interaction for Data Visualisation</h2>

        <p>27/09/2023</p>

        <p>The academic paper "What is Interaction for Data Visualization?" by Evanthia Dimara and Charles Perin serves as a crucial cornerstone in the complex landscape of data visualisation. The article grapples with the elusive yet crucial concept of "interaction", a term that has been ambiguously defined and often misunderstood within the field. This reading is particularly important for me as a website designer as the concept of interaction is not just confined to data visualisation, instead it permeates the broader domains of web design and human-computer interaction, areas that are integral to my journey and future career in this field. In this blog, I aim to dissect the key arguments presented by Evanthia Dimara and Charles Perin and reflect on my individual experiences in my web development process and reflect on the paper's impact on my own understanding of interaction in both data visualisation and web design.</p>

        <article class="collapsible-content">
            
            <p>Evanthia Dimara and Charles Perin's paper, "What is Interaction for Data Visualization?", serves as a comprehensive exploration into the complex subject of interaction within the realm of data visualisation. The authors began by establishing a clear objective to provide a concrete definition for "interaction" as the term has been ambiguously defined and often leads to confusion in both academic and practical contexts. To achieve this goal, they employ a rigorous methodology that involves an in-depth review on the existing literature which spans across various subfields including Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), information visualisation, visual analytics, and scientific visualisation etc. One of the paper's most prominent features is its meticulous approach to literature review, the authors use specific metrics like "Impact" and "Relevance" to sift through the vast library of existing works to ensure that their paper is deeply rooted in credible and impactful research. This methodology is not just thorough but also innovative as it sets a new standard for academic scrutiny in interdisciplinary research. The result of this extensive review is the proposal of a new, synthesised definition of interaction, the authors describe interaction as a "thinking tool", a term that shifts the focus from mere functionality to cognitive enhancement. They argue that this new definition is not just a semantic exercise but a necessary step for advancing the field of data visualisation by providing a clear, unified definition they aim to remove the conceptual barriers that have hindered progress, thereby paving the way for more effective and meaningful interactive data visualisation systems.</p>

            <p>As an Interactive Media student, this concept of interaction is an important aspect in my journey both academically as well as my potential career in this field. Throughout my design process for websites I have made, the question of how users interact with the visual and functional elements has always been the fundamental part, yet after reading Dimara and Perin's paper, I came to realise that my initial understanding of "interaction" was somewhat ambiguous as I often found myself focused in the technicalities of the website’s design, ensuring buttons are clickable, sliders are smooth, or data points are easily navigable without giving much thought to the cognitive aspects that the reading emphasises.</p>

            <p>The reading’s focus on redefining interaction as a "thinking tool" has brought a new understanding of “Interaction” for me as it challenges the conventional knowledge that interaction is only about usability or functionality, yet instead, it elevates the concept to a cognitive level, asking us to consider how interactive elements can facilitate deeper understanding, engagement, or decision-making. This resonates with my personal experiences in past projects where my focus is often on the technicalities of my website with the user's journey and experience through the website, however after reading through the reading, I have come to realise that I should also be considering how each interactive element can contribute to the user's cognitive process, for example does a dropdown menu help the user filter information more effectively? Does a hover effect on a data point provide valuable, immediate context for the user? Etc.</p>

            <p>This change in my perspective and understanding allows me to reconsider my current practices I have employed in designing my websites and in future projects, I plan to incorporate this more holistic understanding of interaction where It's not just about getting the user from Point A to Point B, rather it's about enriching the user’s journey so that they arrive at Point B with a deeper understanding or clearer perspective of the information provided on through the website. This means I will have to rethink the interactive elements in my websites and the data visualisation tools to ensure that they serve a cognitive function instead of just a utilitarian one. Additionally, this paper has inspired me to look deeper into additional research such as cognitive psychology to understand how users process interactive elements and case studies that showcase effective interaction design in web development as these researches can enrich my existing knowledge on web design and allow me to work better and grow further as a web designer in creating designs that focuses on creating the best experience for the user throughout their journey on the site.</p>

            <p>The reading "What is Interaction for Data Visualization?" by Evanthia Dimara and Charles Perin is a crucial work that has significantly broadened my understanding of the concept of “Interaction”, as a web design student and potentially going into this career field, this reading had provided me invaluable understanding in altering my focuses in my development process to push beyond the conventional boundaries of interaction designs that I have focused on prior. The authors’ innovative approach in defining interaction as a “thinking tool” provides a brand-new lens to look through upon the complex subject of interaction and encourages web developers to take a more holistic approach when it comes to designing the interactive system of a website thus making this article an invaluable resource for any that wishes to step into the field of web development as well as my personal improvements in my future projects.</p>
