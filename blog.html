        <h2>Close Reading - Overview of Data Visualisation</h2>
        <p>31/07/2023</p>
        <p>Data visualisation is a critical component in modern data science and communication is the main focus of Chapter 2 in “Embodying Data”. The reading provides a rich historical context and technical details in the exploration of the evolution of data visualisation, going from hand-drawn illustrations to sophisticated computer generated graphics to display various data. The author of the reading shows the importance of comprehensive data for effective visualisation which is a highly important concept for us to understand as a web designer.</p>

        <article class="collapsible-content">
            
            <p>In the reading Chapter 2 of “Embodying Data” the author dives into the concept of data visualisation and tracing its roots back to the 2nd century AD where drawings and visuals were used to illustrate the world and record historical events. The author highlights the importance of data visualisation and its significant contributions to inventions and discoveries throughout human history. With the rapid growth of computer technology, it has brought about a significant shift in the data visualisation field as data analysis can be done quicker and more accurately through computer graphical data visualisation. This important evolution has made data visualisation an integral part of research in many fields.</p>

            <p>The reading also highlights the various forms and characteristics of traditional data visualisation which includes trees, scatter plots, charts, tables, diagrams etc, and the importance of understanding the meaning of the data presented in order to optimal effectiveness and efficiency. The focus of modern digital data visualisation stated by the author is the focus on communication for understanding and interpreting data rather than simply presenting data in a visually appealing way.</p>

            <p>Personally, data visualisation will be an important concept to understand and apply in my works in the future as a website developer as it is important for data to be presented on my websites to not only focus on the visual aesthetics, but also how to present data in a comprehensible way in order to have the viewer understand the data in the most clear and precise way. Websites such as “The Billion Dollar Gram” and “Top 500 Most Used Passwords visualised” both from “Information is Beautiful”, perfects shows examples of how to properly present data in data visualisation, where figures are shown through different presentations such as the The Billion Dollar 0  Gram displays the spending figures in various squares of different sizes, where the larger the spending the larger the squares as well as the numbers being displayed clearly in the top corners of the squares, correct and clear colour coding shows the different categories of spendings such as fighting, losing and giving of each countries displayed. On the other hand, Top 500 Most common passwords displays the data in an oval shape with text of different sizes visualising the most common password. Furthermore the passwords are colour coded once again to show the more in depth data of their different categories which allows for a more in depth break down to the password types thus presenting more data efficiently and effectively without adding any unnecessary visuals. These two data visualisation examples are more akin to the modern computer graphics as mentioned by the author in the reading, while a more traditional bar graph figure is also displayed for the most common passwords, however less information is present of this graph as it is only focused on the overall categories from which passwords are created from unlike the oval graph above which not only shows the data regarding the most common categories, but also specific words that are most commonly present through its use of both colour coding of categories as well as the different sized text that shows the words and how common they are in passwords.</p>

            <p>From both the reading and my own additional researches, I have come to understand the importance of data visualisation in providing not just a visually appealing way for viewers to examine data, but also the importance of the most effective way to present as much data as precisely as possible, the traditional bar graph for example does offer a visually clean presentation of data, however it lacks the more in depth data offered by the oval word chart which not only shows the information from the bar graph, but also adding the more in depth data of which words are the most common as well.</p>>

        <h2>Blog Post 3 - Close Reading - Interaction for Data Visualisation</h2>

        <p>27/09/2023</p>

        <p>The academic paper "What is Interaction for Data Visualization?" by Evanthia Dimara and Charles Perin serves as a crucial cornerstone in the complex landscape of data visualisation. The article grapples with the elusive yet crucial concept of "interaction", a term that has been ambiguously defined and often misunderstood within the field. This reading is particularly important for me as a website designer as the concept of interaction is not just confined to data visualisation, instead it permeates the broader domains of web design and human-computer interaction, areas that are integral to my journey and future career in this field. In this blog, I aim to dissect the key arguments presented by Evanthia Dimara and Charles Perin and reflect on my individual experiences in my web development process and reflect on the paper's impact on my own understanding of interaction in both data visualisation and web design.</p>

        <article class="collapsible-content">
            
            <p>Evanthia Dimara and Charles Perin's paper, "What is Interaction for Data Visualization?", serves as a comprehensive exploration into the complex subject of interaction within the realm of data visualisation. The authors began by establishing a clear objective to provide a concrete definition for "interaction" as the term has been ambiguously defined and often leads to confusion in both academic and practical contexts. To achieve this goal, they employ a rigorous methodology that involves an in-depth review on the existing literature which spans across various subfields including Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), information visualisation, visual analytics, and scientific visualisation etc. One of the paper's most prominent features is its meticulous approach to literature review, the authors use specific metrics like "Impact" and "Relevance" to sift through the vast library of existing works to ensure that their paper is deeply rooted in credible and impactful research. This methodology is not just thorough but also innovative as it sets a new standard for academic scrutiny in interdisciplinary research. The result of this extensive review is the proposal of a new, synthesised definition of interaction, the authors describe interaction as a "thinking tool", a term that shifts the focus from mere functionality to cognitive enhancement. They argue that this new definition is not just a semantic exercise but a necessary step for advancing the field of data visualisation by providing a clear, unified definition they aim to remove the conceptual barriers that have hindered progress, thereby paving the way for more effective and meaningful interactive data visualisation systems.</p>

            <p>As an Interactive Media student, this concept of interaction is an important aspect in my journey both academically as well as my potential career in this field. Throughout my design process for websites I have made, the question of how users interact with the visual and functional elements has always been the fundamental part, yet after reading Dimara and Perin's paper, I came to realise that my initial understanding of "interaction" was somewhat ambiguous as I often found myself focused in the technicalities of the website’s design, ensuring buttons are clickable, sliders are smooth, or data points are easily navigable without giving much thought to the cognitive aspects that the reading emphasises.</p>

            <p>The reading’s focus on redefining interaction as a "thinking tool" has brought a new understanding of “Interaction” for me as it challenges the conventional knowledge that interaction is only about usability or functionality, yet instead, it elevates the concept to a cognitive level, asking us to consider how interactive elements can facilitate deeper understanding, engagement, or decision-making. This resonates with my personal experiences in past projects where my focus is often on the technicalities of my website with the user's journey and experience through the website, however after reading through the reading, I have come to realise that I should also be considering how each interactive element can contribute to the user's cognitive process, for example does a dropdown menu help the user filter information more effectively? Does a hover effect on a data point provide valuable, immediate context for the user? Etc.</p>

            <p>This change in my perspective and understanding allows me to reconsider my current practices I have employed in designing my websites and in future projects, I plan to incorporate this more holistic understanding of interaction where It's not just about getting the user from Point A to Point B, rather it's about enriching the user’s journey so that they arrive at Point B with a deeper understanding or clearer perspective of the information provided on through the website. This means I will have to rethink the interactive elements in my websites and the data visualisation tools to ensure that they serve a cognitive function instead of just a utilitarian one. Additionally, this paper has inspired me to look deeper into additional research such as cognitive psychology to understand how users process interactive elements and case studies that showcase effective interaction design in web development as these researches can enrich my existing knowledge on web design and allow me to work better and grow further as a web designer in creating designs that focuses on creating the best experience for the user throughout their journey on the site.</p>

            <p>The reading "What is Interaction for Data Visualization?" by Evanthia Dimara and Charles Perin is a crucial work that has significantly broadened my understanding of the concept of “Interaction”, as a web design student and potentially going into this career field, this reading had provided me invaluable understanding in altering my focuses in my development process to push beyond the conventional boundaries of interaction designs that I have focused on prior. The authors’ innovative approach in defining interaction as a “thinking tool” provides a brand-new lens to look through upon the complex subject of interaction and encourages web developers to take a more holistic approach when it comes to designing the interactive system of a website thus making this article an invaluable resource for any that wishes to step into the field of web development as well as my personal improvements in my future projects.</p>

        <h2>Blog Post 4 - Critical Reflection - Your Data-Driven Artwork</h2>

        <p>28/10/2023</p>

        <p>In the duration of working on my data art, I had run into multiple issues that I had to overcome from both coding and designing of the artwork. My main concern for my data art was that the way I wanted to present the data might be confused with just another data graph, however eventually I had settled on using NASA’s NEO API to create an artwork that showed the Near-Earth Objects’ location and size in comparison to Earth itself and presented in a way that resembled a flower with petals stretching out from the nectar being Earth itself.</p>

        <article class="collapsible-content">
            
            <p>Throughout the process of making my data art, my main concern was how could I make a data driven artwork without making it just another graph and I had troubles understanding what exactly constitutes as artwork created to present data pulled from the NASA API, however through multiple iterations of using different APIs and different creative ways of presenting the data from them, I eventually decided to use the NEO API and create an artwork that shows the distance and size of Near-Earth Objects through a top down view of Earth at the centre with lines protruding out that creates a visual representation of their distances from Earth and ending the line with circles of different sizes that shows the scale of these objects in comparison to our planet. The way I chose to present the NEO data allowed for a fascinating image that presents the data in an artistic way that could communicate its data with the viewer emotionally as they see the vast amount of objects that are actually around our planet, but also create a sense of dread as they see the sheer sizes of some of the objects which at times could be extremely close to our planet, this resonates with Viéga and Wattenberg’s assertion that “The point is not to make pretty pictures, but rather to create a visual language that can help people think.” (Viégas & Wattenberg, 2007, p. 5)</p>

            <p>In my data art, Earth at the centre of the piece is presented as a blue ball as our planets is often referred to as the blue jewel of the solar system, with white lines that extends from the centre to not only highlight the distance in contrast to the dark background of the page, but to also stick to the overall colour scheme of my website, on the other hand the dots that presents the size of the NEO are in a transparent red is meant to not only highlight the NEOs to create a sense of curiosity by the amount of objects that are present which ties to what Riche et al. describe as "exploration and explanation" in data storytelling, where the data doesn't just tell a story but invites the viewer to explore further (Riche et al., 2018, p. 45), but also provoke a sense of caution for the viewer as all these objects of different size and distance are all present around our planets and some are of considerable size which may or may not present as a potential threat to our planet and our existence which aligns to what Viégas and Wattenberg have argued, that data visualisation can transcend mere analytics to offer layers of interpretation (Viégas & Wattenberg, 2007).</p>

            <p>My design of the data art was also inspired by the ‘focus + context’ notion highlighted by Riche et al. (Riche et al., 2018). as the simple and straightforward design allows the viewer to understand the data at various scales while also following Viégas and Wattenberg's argument for "revealing the data" as to giving the viewer of my art a clear insight into the raw data that the art is made of. My Data art engages with the viewer both emotionally through the provoking of curiosity and caution by presenting the size and distance of various objects which serves as a “cognitive tool” as said by Viégas and Wattenberg. My artwork successfully engages with the data set by presenting them in a clear and simple to understand and reveals a new way of thinking about the data as simple numbers of a screen, the visual representation of the NEOs both aligns with Riche et al. and Viégas and Wattenberg’s theoretical framework on data driven art. There are of course steps I could take to improve this artwork even more, such as using NASA’s EPIC API to show realistic images of Earth that rotates in real time to further connect with the viewer through a constant and realistic reminder that these objects are around us rather than just presenting Earth as a blue ball or present a threat level counter based on the size and distance of NEOs to further invoke the existential question of how many more NEOs are out there that we aren’t tracking, how big could these objects get and how many would potentially pose a threat to our planet.</p>

            <p>Overall I think my data art was a success in both presenting the raw data to the viewer in a way that would reveal new ways of thinking and engaging with the data as well as connect with the viewers on an emotional level that both invokes curiosity of the unknown and the existential dread for these objects that exists constantly around us, making the viewer question how many more objects of various sizes and distance are out there and how many of them could potentially pose a threat to our existence as a whole.</p>

        <h2>Blog Post 5 - Data Visualisation, Art, and Representation</h2>

        <p>14/11/2023</p>

        <p>In the modern contemporary digital age, the intersection of Data Visualization and Data Art emerges as a crucial area in the representation and interpretation of information. These mediums, while still distinct in their applications, have collectively challenged and refined our understanding of data representation in digital media. Viégas and Wattenberg (2007) articulated that data visualisation is not just a scientific tool, but also a medium with aesthetic and narrative potential, in this blog I aim to dive into the intricate relationships between Data Visualization and Data Art to explore how they navigate the realms of clarity, bias, and ethical representation. Through the scholarly insights from Janssens (2016) and Kidd (2015), I will delve into how these forms transform data from mere numbers into meaningful narratives and how they influence our perception and understanding of information.</p>

        <article class="collapsible-content">
            
            <p>Data visualisation serves as an immensely powerful tool to simplify complex information by making it accessible and comprehensible, Viégas and Wattenberg (2007) explores the intersection of data visualisation with artistic practices in revealing how artistic methods can enhance the presentation and understanding of data. This ability to transform data into an easily interpretable visual format is critical in various fields from science to business to education. However, in the strife for clarity, one must be careful of the inherent biases in data representation as Janssens (2016) discusses, every choice in visualisation, from colour schemes to scale can carry potential biases that can influence interpretation. This is particularly relevant in the context of risky technologies, where ethical considerations play a crucial role. Janssens highlights the significant contribution of techno-art in rendering technological advancements and their societal impacts more palpable and understandable to a wider audience as this approach suggests that integrating artistic insights into data visualisation can offer diverse perspectives, helping to mitigate biases inherent in data representation.</p>

            <p>The challenges of data representation lies in balancing clarity with an awareness of potential biases. This is where the role of artistic practices in data visualisation becomes vital, where artists with their unique perspectives and approaches can challenge the conventional data representations, where they can uncover the underlying biases and propose more nuanced visual narratives. Viégas and Wattenberg (2007) demonstrated this with examples of artistic data visualisations that surpassed the traditional analytical boundaries, thus offering new ways to engage and understand data. While data visualisation is an important tool for clarity, it is also important to recognise and address the biases it can potentially perpetuate. The Integration of artistic practices into data visualisation can provide a more holistic and ethical approach to data representation, thus ensuring a fair and comprehensive understanding of the data presented.</p>

            <p>Modern data art surpasses the traditional realms of data visualisation through incorporating aesthetic and emotional dimensions, thus offering a deeper and more holistic understanding of data. Janssens (2016) highlights the value of this artistic approach particularly in the context of ethically charged and technologically complex data as data art not only presents information but also evokes emotional responses from the viewer as to enable a more profound engagement with the data. The connection between aesthetics and data in art pieces can lead to new insights and perspectives as Janssens observes, art’s role in ethical reflection is significant especially in contemplating the implications presented by risky technologies. Through integrating artistic elements, data art can challenge viewers' perceptions by provoking thought and emotional reactions that pure data visualisation may not achieve as this emotional engagement is crucial in making abstract or complex data more tangible and relatable to the audience.</p>

            <p>Additionally, data art's ability to represent data in a more nuanced and interpretive way allows for the exploration of subjective experiences and societal implications. Janssens (2016) suggests that art contributes to a broader ethical discourse by providing other alternative viewpoints and questioning established norms. In the realm of data representation this means not just showing data but also interpreting and critiquing it in order to add layers of meaning that goes above and beyond mere facts and figures, thus allowing data art to enrich the experience of data interaction as it adds depth to data representation through aesthetic appeal and provoking emotional responses from the viewer to achieve a deeper understanding and connection with the data. Through doing so, data art plays an important role in ethical reflections and discussions particularly in fields involving complex and morally charged data.</p>

            <p>The intersection of data art and data visualisation presents a fascinating view of how these two fields overlap and diverge in influencing the perception and understanding of data. While data visualisation is primarily concerned with clarity, precision, and efficiency in conveying information to the viewer as Viégas and Wattenberg (2007) suggested, it emphasises the accurate and efficient communication of data often in service of decision-making or analysis. On the other hand, data art introduces a narrative and emotional driven aspect to the representation of data going beyond mere data representation in order to evoke an emotional or aesthetic response upon viewing as seen in Janssens’ (2016) discussion on the role of art in ethical reflection. This approach allows data art to convey complex themes and provoke thought in ways that traditional data visualisation may not be able to achieve. However, the distinction is not always so clear cut as Kidd (2015) suggests in the discussion of representation theories, the line between art and visualisation can be fluid, where data visualisation can integrate aesthetic elements to enhance engagement and comprehension for the viewer, data art may employ structured data visualisation techniques to ground its unique artistic narratives in real world contexts. The influence of both fields on perception and understanding is profound as data visualisation offers clarity and objectivity help aiding in quick comprehension and analysis. Data art, on the other hand, provides a richer and more subjective experience in inviting viewers to engage with data on a deeper emotional and intellectual level. Ultimately, the relationship between data art and visualisation highlights the diverse ways in which data can be represented and understood, it shows the importance of considering both objective clarity and subjective interpretation in the realm of data representation.</p>

            <p>Another important aspect in the realm of data representation is the ethical considerations that play a crucial role, particularly in how data is presented and interpreted by both the artist and the viewer as Kidd (2015) notes in the exploration of representation theories, the responsibility of fair and balanced representation is critical and this responsibility extends to both data visualisation and data art as both can substantially influence public perception and decision-making. The ethical implications of representing data are multifaceted where firstly, there's the accuracy and integrity of the data itself as misrepresentation or faulty uncurated data, whether intentional or not can lead to misinformation and have substantial consequences on both the public and the creators themselves. This is particularly true in fields like healthcare, finance and public policy, where data-driven decisions can impact countless lives directly. Another aspect is the potential for bias in data representation as even choices that seem as insignificant such as the colour schemes or scale adjustments in visualisations can subtly influence the interpretation of the viewer. In data art where representation often leans towards a narrative or thematic presentation, the artist's own perspective might overshadow the objective data interpretation, in turn leading to a skewed perception by the viewer. Kidd’s (2015) discussion also highlights the importance of context in data representation, where decontextualized data can be misleading as it strips away the nuances and complexities that are often critical for a full understanding of the subject matter presented. Thus, providing context and avoiding oversimplification are crucial ethical obligations for those engaged in data representation.</p>

            <p>Lastly, there is the aspect of accessibility and inclusivity in data representation, ensuring that data is presented in a manner that can be easily accessible to a diverse audience is vital in considering factors like colour blindness or educational background is an ethical consideration that cannot be overlooked. Ethical data representation requires a careful balance as it requires maintaining the integrity and accuracy of data while being mindful of potential biases and the importance of context. It also requires those that present the data to ensure that data is accessible and inclusive by a wide audience in order to uphold these important ethical standards for the credibility and effectiveness of both data visualisation and data art.</p>
        
            <p>In conclusion, the intricate landscape of Data Visualization and Data Art reveals both their benefits and challenges in presenting clear and objective data, while these mediums adequately transform abstract data into meaningful narratives, they also grapple with issues of bias and ethical representation. The combination of analytical clarity with artistic interpretation enriches our understanding through provoking both a subjective and emotional response from the viewer, yet it demands careful balancing by the creators to avoid misleading representations no matter how insignificant as they could have a major impact on countless people if falsely presented. Future of Data Visualisation and Data art should focus on resolving these challenges and seek out innovative ways to integrate the strengths of both fields while minimising their limitations. This ongoing process will refine the representation of data in the contemporary digital landscape from simple numbers to intricate data visualisation and art that provoke the viewer not only in an objective thought process, but a subjective and emotional response that allows them to gain a deeper understanding of the data itself.</p>
