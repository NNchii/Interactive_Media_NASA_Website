        <h2>Close Reading - Overview of Data Visualisation</h2>
        <p>31/07/2023</p>
        <p>Data visualisation is a critical component in modern data science and communication is the main focus of Chapter 2 in “Embodying Data”. The reading provides a rich historical context and technical details in the exploration of the evolution of data visualisation, going from hand-drawn illustrations to sophisticated computer generated graphics to display various data. The author of the reading shows the importance of comprehensive data for effective visualisation which is a highly important concept for us to understand as a web designer.</p>

            <p>In the reading Chapter 2 of “Embodying Data” the author dives into the concept of data visualisation and tracing its roots back to the 2nd century AD where drawings and visuals were used to illustrate the world and record historical events. The author highlights the importance of data visualisation and its significant contributions to inventions and discoveries throughout human history. With the rapid growth of computer technology, it has brought about a significant shift in the data visualisation field as data analysis can be done quicker and more accurately through computer graphical data visualisation. This important evolution has made data visualisation an integral part of research in many fields.</p>

            <p>The reading also highlights the various forms and characteristics of traditional data visualisation which includes trees, scatter plots, charts, tables, diagrams etc, and the importance of understanding the meaning of the data presented in order to optimal effectiveness and efficiency. The focus of modern digital data visualisation stated by the author is the focus on communication for understanding and interpreting data rather than simply presenting data in a visually appealing way.</p>

            <p>Personally, data visualisation will be an important concept to understand and apply in my works in the future as a website developer as it is important for data to be presented on my websites to not only focus on the visual aesthetics, but also how to present data in a comprehensible way in order to have the viewer understand the data in the most clear and precise way. Websites such as “The Billion Dollar Gram” and “Top 500 Most Used Passwords visualised” both from “Information is Beautiful”, perfects shows examples of how to properly present data in data visualisation, where figures are shown through different presentations such as the The Billion Dollar 0  Gram displays the spending figures in various squares of different sizes, where the larger the spending the larger the squares as well as the numbers being displayed clearly in the top corners of the squares, correct and clear colour coding shows the different categories of spendings such as fighting, losing and giving of each countries displayed. On the other hand, Top 500 Most common passwords displays the data in an oval shape with text of different sizes visualising the most common password. Furthermore the passwords are colour coded once again to show the more in depth data of their different categories which allows for a more in depth break down to the password types thus presenting more data efficiently and effectively without adding any unnecessary visuals. These two data visualisation examples are more akin to the modern computer graphics as mentioned by the author in the reading, while a more traditional bar graph figure is also displayed for the most common passwords, however less information is present of this graph as it is only focused on the overall categories from which passwords are created from unlike the oval graph above which not only shows the data regarding the most common categories, but also specific words that are most commonly present through its use of both colour coding of categories as well as the different sized text that shows the words and how common they are in passwords.</p>

            <p>From both the reading and my own additional researches, I have come to understand the importance of data visualisation in providing not just a visually appealing way for viewers to examine data, but also the importance of the most effective way to present as much data as precisely as possible, the traditional bar graph for example does offer a visually clean presentation of data, however it lacks the more in depth data offered by the oval word chart which not only shows the information from the bar graph, but also adding the more in depth data of which words are the most common as well.</p>>
