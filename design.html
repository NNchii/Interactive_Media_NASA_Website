                <h2>Goal Alignment</h2>
                <h3>My Goal:</h3>
                <p>I aim to design an immersive space-themed website that leverages NASA's rich data repository. The website will be a blend of aesthetics and functionality, ensuring that visitors not only appreciate the beauty of space but also understand the data behind it. The design will be responsive, ensuring a seamless experience across devices.</p>

                <h3>My User:</h3>
                <p>The primary audience for this website is space enthusiasts, educators, and students. By presenting NASA's data in a visually appealing and interactive manner, I hope to make space exploration more accessible and engaging to a broader audience.</p>

                <h2>Information Structure</h2>
                
                <p>The primary audience for this website is space enthusiasts, educators, and students. By presenting NASA's data in a visually appealing and interactive manner, I hope to make space exploration more accessible and engaging to a broader audience.</p>
                <p>The website is segmented into five main sections: home, blogs, design, data art, and data visualization. The blog page features a prominent 'featured blog' followed by other articles. Each blog entry is accompanied by an image and has a 'read more' feature, allowing users to expand the content as they wish.</p>
            
                <h2>User Flow</h2>

                <p>The user's journey begins on the homepage, where they can immerse themselves in the slideshow or navigate to other sections using the placards. On the blog page, users can delve into detailed articles, with the option to expand or collapse content for convenience. The design page offers insights into the website's creation process, while the data art and visualization pages, though currently placeholders, promise future content that will further enrich the user's experience.</p>

                <h2>Style Process</h2>
                <h3>Visual Aesthetic:</h3>
                <p>The website exudes a space-themed aesthetic, with a custom background that evokes the vastness of the cosmos. Placards and other elements have subtle animations, enhancing user interactivity and engagement.</p>

                <h2>Style Guide</h2>
                
                <h3>Goal and Aesthetic:</h3>
                <p>The website's design encapsulates the wonder of space exploration, blending rich visuals with informative content.</p>
            
                <h3>Visual Design Elements:</h3>
                <p><strong>Space Theme:</strong> The overarching space theme is evident in the custom backgrounds, animations, and the overall color palette. The majority black and blue gradient fits the theme of NASA as well as space itself.</p>
                <p><strong>Readability and Legibility:</strong> Fonts are chosen for clarity against the cosmic backdrop. The 'read more' feature in blogs ensures that content is presented concisely, with users having control over content expansion.</p>
                <p><strong>Colors:</strong> The color palette is inspired by space â€“ deep blues, starry whites, and the custom background picture further plays into the overall space theme. This palette complements the NASA images and creates a cohesive visual experience.</p>
                <p><strong>Interactivity:</strong> Elements like the placards animate upon hover, providing responsive feedback to users. the 'read more' feature in blogs enhance user interactivity so to not clog up the page with too much texts.</p>
                <p><strong>Typography:</strong> The typography is modern and legible, ensuring that the content is easily readable against the space-themed backgrounds. I chose the font due to it's clean and minialistic design which fits the overall minimalistic design of the website and blends well into the space theme.</p>
                <p><strong>Alignment:</strong> Consistent alignment and spacing ensure that the website looks organized and is easy to navigate, despite the dynamic nature of its content.</p>

I did this to give a overview for the sections of my website so that the viewer can get an idea on what content is in this website without having to look through everything, the placards also function as shortcut that takes them to the corresponding pages. The website is centred around NASA data so the NASA placard gives the viewer in introduction to the history of NASA.</p>

I chose to include an image above the blog so I can add any related images to act as a thumbnail for each blog post, currently they are just placeholder images. I've designed it so that the viewers can expand and retract the blogs whenever they want so that the page won't just be filled with long sections of text, this why the blog page is more organised. Each blog post has the first paragraph visible without having to expand, I did this so that the viewer can read through the intro to each blog and see if they would like to expand and read more or not.</p>
